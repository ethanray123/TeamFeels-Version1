# TeamFeels-Version1
I added new branches corresponding to their respective purposes. As mentioned by mentors, this is a better approach to nomenclature. I advise we follow this naming convention.

Also please be aware that I added new cards in the Trello page. If you choose to pursue a task, please assign yourself to that card so that we won't be caught doing the same task.

Thanks.

I created a new branch coz I cannot push on the branch that joe created
error: src refspec LobbyHandling does not match any.
